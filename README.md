# spellingBee

This is a very rough bit of code to see if we can find most of the works for the NYT spelling bee

Note this is for cheating, don't use this to actually play the game!

Big thanks to http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html where I pulled the word list from

I called the yellow letter in the center the key word. 

Should be pretty easy to play.
